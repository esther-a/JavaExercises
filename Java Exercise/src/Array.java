/* you create an array class called Array.  Then a public method called display is created. then you declare the array and what values you want to put inside of them.
then the for loop is created which states a variable (i) at 0. And that when your variable i is smaller than the lenght of the array, you should add 1 to i. then you print out
a position in the array that is constantly changing which is i
